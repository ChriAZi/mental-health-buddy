          - speech: $session.params.transition Your calculated score came out to be
              $session.params.finalScore out of 27. This means that you fall into
              the category of $session.params.scoreCategory. $session.params.emotionalResponse
              I would recommend you to $session.params.intervention. The benefits
              of that are $session.params.interventionBenefits. Just to summarize
              again. Your score was $session.params.finalScore which puts you into
              the category of $session.params.scoreCategory. $session.params.emotionalResponseSummary
              As described before, the next step for you would now be to $session.params.interventionSummary.
              I hope that all makes sense to you and you know where to go from here.
              If not you can ask me to repeat the explanation by saying 'Repeat the
              explanation' or conclude our session by saying "Cancel".
