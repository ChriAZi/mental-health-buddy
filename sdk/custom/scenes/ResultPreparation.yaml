                talk about your questionnaire results. For this I first want to understand
                how much information you want me to give to you. You can either choose
                a simple explanation by saying "I want the simple explanation" or
                get a more in-depth one by saying "Give me more details".

              with me. The last step of our checkup is talking about your questionnaire
              results. As this can be a sensitive topic, I would recommend you to
              be in a quiet and private place where you are not going to be disturbed
              for the next few minutes. If you feel more comfortable doing so, you
              can also ask a close friend or relative to join you for this part. Once
              you feel ready, just tell me by saying 'I am ready'.
