          - speech: $session.params.transition As you might remember from the beginning,
              the answers you give during the checkup create a score between 0 and
              27. The higher this score, the more severe your depressive symptoms
              are. Your calculated score came out to be $session.params.finalScore
              out of 27. This means that you fall into the category of $session.params.scoreCategory.
              $session.params.emotionalResponse I would recommend you to $session.params.intervention.
              The benefits of that are $session.params.interventionBenefits. Just
              to summarize again. Your score was $session.params.finalScore which
              puts you into the category of $session.params.scoreCategory. $session.params.emotionalResponseSummary
              As described before, the next step for you would now be to $session.params.interventionSummary.
              I hope that all makes sense to you and you know where to go from here.
              If not you can ask me to repeat the explanation by saying 'Repeat the
              explanation' or conclude our session by saying "Cancel".
