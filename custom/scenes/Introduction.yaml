          - speech: In our session we are going to talk about nine mental health related questions which are build on the Patient Health Questionnaire. This questionnaire is often used as a diagnosis tool by trained professionals. Each question describes a different situation and can be answered using one of four answer options. An answer option describes how often in the last two weeks you have experienced the situation as described in the question. For each question you can choose from the following options- "not at all", "several days", "more than half the days" and "almost every day". And dont worry, you dont need to remember them now. You can ask me for the answer options at any time during our session. If you now feel ready to start the questionnaire, you can say "Start questionnaire". If you would like to get more information about the questionnaire or our session in general, just say "Tell me more".
