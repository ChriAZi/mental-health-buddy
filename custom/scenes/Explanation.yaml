            - speech: The questionnaire we are using during our session is build on the Patient Health Questionnaire - short PHQ, which is often used as a diagnosis tool by trained professionals. The PHQ is made up of different modules that all focus on a specific aspect of mental health. The module we are using is the depression module. It can help us detect symptoms and understand the severity of a potential depressive illness. As with all questionnaires, this one is not perfect. However, it has been shown repeatedly that it can reliably detect depression. I hope that answers your question, do you have any further questions?

            - speech: Okay, lets go through an example questions together. One of the question might be the following - How often have you felt little interest in doing things over the past two weeks? You could now answer by using one of the four answer options - "not at all", "several days", "more than half the days", "almost every day". In case you dont know what to answer at first, just go with your gut feeling, and remember that there are no right or wrong answers. Just keep in mind that we are interested in how you felt over the last two weeks in particular. I hope that example helps, do you have any further questions?

Even if you feel healthy and well, going through the questionnaire might be a valuable experience, and you might even discover something about yourself that you did not know before. I hope that answers your question, do you have any further questions?

            - speech: The questionnaire consists of nine questions and creates a mental health score depending on your answers. This score can be between 0 and 27, and gives you an indication of your current state of mental health. The higher the score, the more likely you are experiencing difficulties with your mental health. Once you have answered all of the nine questions, you will receive your score, and a potential next step you can take to better your situation. Depending on your score, this can range from just going for a walk to booking an appointment with a therapist. One more important thing to keep in mind - the mentioned score is only valid, if you answer all of the nine questions, meaning you cannot skip questions. I hope that answers your question, do you have any further questions?
